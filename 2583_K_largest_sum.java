/*The code uses a PriorityQueue (a min heap implementation) to store the k largest level sums encountered so far. It also uses a Queue to traverse the binary tree level by level, starting from the root.
In the main loop, for each level, the sum of node values is calculated and added to the PriorityQueue. If the PriorityQueue has not reached k elements yet, the current sum is added without any further checks. Otherwise, the current sum is compared to the smallest element in the PriorityQueue (the top element), and if it is greater, the smallest element is removed and the current sum is added.
Finally, if the PriorityQueue has less than k elements, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the smallest element in the PriorityQueue (which is the k-th largest level sum). */
